Scripts for installing or setting up...... stuff

### Docker
Scripts to install docker in Linux Mint. Should work in Ubuntu too. Run the script with sudo. First run the ....-v1.sh script.
This will update and restart the machine for finalizing the setup. Ufter rebooting run the second script again with sudo.


### Ubuntu
`more_workspaces.sh` - self explainig :). Adds more workspaces in Ubuntu. The default ammount is 3x3, but also can be set by argument
when the sh script is called.
